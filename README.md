# ArmorInteraction
Adds bending-armor interaction to your ProjectKorra server.

ArmorInteraction is a plugin that will allow you to customize how the damage done by bending abilities is affected by certain types of armor (leather, chainmail, iron, and diamond). Customize the power of these armor types in the config.yml.

* Note: The plugin uses a max power potential in it's algorithm. It gets this value from totaling the power of all the diamond armors. In other words, diamond armor is assumed to be the most powerful. When changing the configuration, be sure to total the armor types and make sure that the combined power of diamond is stronger than that of other armor types. By default, diamond's combined power is 16.
